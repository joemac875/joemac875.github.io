For my junior undergraduate research project, I chose to focus on swarm intelligence. In particular, I simulated the process of phagocytosis - when one cell eats another - by using a swarm of Kilobots. These robots are developed by Harvard and designed to be used in swarm robotics applications.



Alone, each Kilobot is unable to perform any meaningful function, but as a group they perform emergent behavior matching that of a phagocyte. My simulation fully captures the  searching, movement, and engulfing behavior of a phagocyte, but not the actual destruction of foreign bodies.
