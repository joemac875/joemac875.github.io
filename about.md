Born and raised on a small farm outside of an equally small town in rural Michigan, I grew up surrounded by corn  fields, forests, and lakes. My childhood was spent fighting mythical creatures in pastures, working in the garden, and annoying my two older sisters. Despite my current interests, most of my early years were spent without very much technology. I occasionally played Age of Empires or Halo on our old desktop computer, but unlike my peers, I wasn’t allowed consoles or video games.

I think it was this lack of video games that sparked my interest in computers and electronics. In middle school I obsessively  computer specs and parts, crafting dream machines that fell far out of a 10 year old’s budget. I started sneaking an external hard drive with games installed to my ‘Computers’ class.

Just before high school, my dad got me a kit from DIY Drones and a fixed wing RC plane. The kit included an Arduino Mega and a custom shield with all sorts of sensors on it. Once I finally got everything together and working, I sent the thing on a beautiful maiden voyage around our pasture. Its second journey, however, ended in disaster when something failed and it sailed away into the forest, never to be seen again.

Upon my arrival at college, I began to deviate from the tech path. I briefly considered a major in anthropology, then moved my sights to classical studies. Over time however, I realized that the only classes I felt a true passion for were those in the computer science (which I always managed to fit into my schedule). Its what I don't get sick of after a late night of study or work and what I look forward to at the start of the day. And that's how I have become what I am now, a computer science major. Much of the work I have done during this time can be found on this website!
